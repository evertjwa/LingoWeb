# LingoWeb
Welcome to this first upload of LingoWeb. A Java Web Application which can easily find all matching terms from a WildCard Lucene Query. Lingo is a popular Television game in Belgium and the Netherlands. This Web App is a helper. You can use it to quickly find all words with a given length and one or more start characters.

This App is Powered by Apache Lucene, the blazing fast Open Source Search Engine.

Please note this App is early beta. Documentation, known issues and reporting new issues can be found here I can not be held responsible in any way for any damage caused by the use of this App.

I am working on more Lucene / Solr and Nutch Projects. For the latest info check my blog regularly.
